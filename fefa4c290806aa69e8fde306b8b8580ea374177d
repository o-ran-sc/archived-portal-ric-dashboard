      "message": "Nicolas, thank you for trying to implement this but my idea just didn\u0027t work out.  I\u0027d like to change this to remove the failure possibility.  One idea - this method could accept the selected instance key value to build a path.  Another idea - remove the method entirely and publish the \"api\" and \"ric\" path components as well-known constants for use by the service classes.  What do you think?",
