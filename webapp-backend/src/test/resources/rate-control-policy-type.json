An instance of the policy specifies the traffic class to which it applies and parameters to use to control how much it must be throttled in case of an overload. Each instance of the policy that is created MUST be associated with a unique class ID (identifyed by the key 'class', which is used by the xAPP to differentiate traffic. If an agent tries to create a policy with the SAME class id, it will be rejected by the xAPP, even if it has a unique policy instance id. ",
